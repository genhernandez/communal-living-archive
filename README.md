#About
The Communal Living Archive is a web application developed to make visible the everyday struggles and celebrations of sexually heterodox and gender variant farmworkers in Agricultural California. The content is curated by Elisa Oceguera, a doctoral candidate at UC Davis who is the primary investigator working with these communities. 

It was developed using FullPage.js and A-frame. You can visit the live website at: https://communal-living-archive.herokuapp.com

#Future Work
- The mobile views need more work so that all media is accessible across various screen sizes
- The VR environments are placeholders while the interviews are being finalized
- Additional sections will be added providing more context for the problems and triumphs that LGBTQ farmworks are facing
